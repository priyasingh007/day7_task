#linear algebra with Numpy:
#Numpy provides the following functions to perform the different algebraic calculations on the input data.

#Function->Definition
#dot()->It is used to calculate the dot product of two arrays.
#vdot()->It is used to calculate the dot product of two vectors.
#inner()->It is used to calculate the inner product of two arrays.
#matmul()->It is used to calculate the matrix multiplication of two arrays.
#det()->It is used to calculate the determinant of a matrix.
#solve()->It is used to solve the linear matrix equation.
#inv()->It is used to calculate the multiplicative inverse of the matrix.

# In[3]:


#The dot product is calculated as:

#[100 * 10 + 200 * 12, 100 * 20 + 200 * 21] [23*10+12*12, 23*20 + 12*21]

#vdot is calculated as

#It is used to return the multiplication of the two matrices.
#It gives an error if the shape of both matrices is not aligned for multiplication

#The numpy.linalg.det() function is used to calculate the determinant of the matrix

#Vectorized Operation in Numpy:
#The concept of vectorized operations on NumPy allows the use of more optimal and pre-compiled functions and mathematical operations on NumPy array objects and data sequences.
#The Output and Operations will speed-up when compared to simple non-vectorized operations.


# In[11]:


#Universal function
#Universal functions in Numpy are simple mathematical functions. It is just a term that we gave to mathematical functions in the Numpy library.
#Numpy provides various universal functions that cover a wide variety of operations.

#These functions operates on ndarray (N-dimensional array) i.e Numpyâ€™s array class.
#>It performs fast element-wise array operations.
#>It supports various features like array broadcasting, type casting etc.
#>Numpy, universal functions are objects those belongs to numpy.ufunc class.
